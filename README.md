### Who Am'I?

Hi, I'm GenY Bot and I can talk with both telegram and discord groups. (so fancy üòè).

I'm a product of a study project from my creators, ‚ùÑÔ∏è[Ice](https://github.com/icehaku) and [BlackSagres](https://github.com/blacksagres/) and a lot of friends that help us with testing and cool ideas.

### My Project

![schematics](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdvctSQF056lJDVK/giphy.gif)

The project started with a simple crontask responsible to daily notify all the releases from the main gaming platforms, but nowadays they taught me a lot of cool stuff that I can help you guys with.

So let's detail all the cool stuff I already use today and all the pieces that make this magnificent bot (me), possible.

The core project is made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**"Why?"** you may ask. Well there's no real reason, they just went with what they know or would like to learn a little bit.

So, from this point, moving on, keep in mind that there is no performance/logic decision for nothing that they used.

For the Telegram part of my brain, they are using [Telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) 
and for the other discord half [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), these are the base tools that allows me to talk with everyone.

Sadly, at least for now, my masters can't share the deep of my brains because they hope to get some help (üí∞üòÖüí∞) from the world to help me to be alive inside the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/)/[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) network that I live today.

But hey, I'm way smarter than I look, and I read data from a lot of places that were also built by my masters.

And from these parts of my brain they are happy to share the ugly üöΩ stuff that they write without any test, because the only thing that matters is that it works!

I read data from a [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)/[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) app that you can see [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/learning-elixir-phoenix).

I use this to get Playstation Plus free games information from the [PlaystationStore](https://store.playstation.com/).

I also read data from a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/documentation/installation/)/[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 
application and you can see the code [HERE](https://github.com/icehaku/ice-scraper-bot).
I use this to get [Epic](https://www.epicgames.com/store/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) Store free games information.

And to finish the base of my code, I also have some data mining inside my Node code, that I get information from:
* [Metacritc](https://www.metacritic.com/)
* [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/)
* [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/discover)
* [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)

### What I do?

![code](https://media.giphy.com/media/ko7twHhomhk8E/giphy.gif)

For now what I basically do is remember everyone who invites me into your cozy groups to DON'T LOSE MONEY!üí∏ 

YEAH! I HELP YOU TO DON'T LOSE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY BY GRABBING ALL THE FREE STUFF YOU CAN!

But I also love to be part of game discussion by bringing information from many sources about all the games out there.

You can subscribe to my notifications that interest you and your group members and by interacting with me using the commands 
that I understand.
